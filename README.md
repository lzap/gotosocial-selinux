# GoToSocial SELinux poclicy

SELinux policies for GoToSocial

##Â Assumptions

The policy assumes that:

* `gotosocial` binary is either in `/usr/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`.
* `config.yaml` binary is either in `/etc/gotosocial` or `/usr/local/etc/gotosocial`.
* Data is either in `/var/lib/gotosocial` or `/gotosocial`.
* Postgres is running locally or remotely on 5432 port.

## Compiling and loading

To locally compile and load the policy:

    make -f /usr/share/selinux/devel/Makefile load
    /usr/sbin/semodule -i gotosocial.pp
    ./gotosocial-selinux-relabel

Then restart the service

## Changing PostgreSQL port

    semanage port -a -t postgresql_port_t -p tcp 5454

## Changing listening HTTP port

Run this command (no restart of anything is needed):

    semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 8085

## Debugging CIL

From time to time, SELinux spills out a cryptic error. To generate CLI source from te/pp file, do:

    cat foreman.pp | /usr/libexec/selinux/hll/pp > /tmp/foreman.cil
